# Scripts/Notes to help me use openstack-k8s-operators

I have been using 
[osp-director-dev-tools](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/osp-director-dev-tools)
to install the 
[osp-director-operator](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/osp-director-operator)
and its dependencies with Ceph.

This directory has some scripts and notes to help me work 
in that environment.
